Place IDs can be used with other Google APIs, including the Google Places API and the Google Maps JavaScript API. For example, if you need to get road names for the snapped points returned by the Google Maps Roads API, you can pass the placeId to the Google Places API or the Google Maps Geocoding API. Within the Google Maps Roads API, you can pass the placeId to the speedLimit method to determine the speed limit along that road segment.
